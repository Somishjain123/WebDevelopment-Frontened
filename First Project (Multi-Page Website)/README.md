# SkillSwap (Multi-Page Website)

This repository contains the front-end code for a multi-page web application. It showcases my ability to build a comprehensive, multi-section website with a focus on user interface design, navigation, and seamless user experience.

### **Project Overview**

The project is structured with multiple HTML pages, each serving a distinct purpose:
- **`index.html`**: The main landing page.
- **`about.html`**: Provides information about the platform's mission and goals.
- **`skills.html`**: A section for exploring available skills.
- **`search.html`**: A functional search page that demonstrates dynamic filtering.
- **`swap.html`**: A form for users to propose skill swaps.
- **`support.html`**: A support hub with an FAQ, blog, and contact form.
- **`auth.html`**: A login and registration page with form toggling.
- **`Dashboard.html`**: A user dashboard with navigation links.

A key feature of this project is a live, real-time chat functionality, which is handled in a separate module. This demonstrates my ability to integrate a front-end with a backend service.

### **Technologies Used**

- **HTML5:** For structuring all pages and content.
- **CSS3:** For styling, responsive design, and providing a cohesive user experience across all pages.
- **JavaScript (ES6+):** For handling interactive elements, form validation, and page routing.
- **Firebase:** The real-time chat feature is integrated with Firebase, showcasing my experience with backend services and APIs.
