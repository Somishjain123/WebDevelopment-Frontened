# Skill Swap (One-Page Website)

This repository contains the code for a sleek, single-page website that demonstrates my skills in building a modern, interactive user interface. This project is designed to present all content on a single page using smooth scrolling and dynamic sections.

### **Project Overview**

The website is a clean, visually appealing portfolio piece that showcases a range of front-end skills. It includes key sections such as:
- **Home:** An introductory hero section.
- **About Us:** Details about the platform's mission.
- **Features:** A grid showcasing core features with icons.
- **Partners:** A section with partner logos.
- **User Stories:** A horizontally-scrolling testimonial section.
- **Newsletter:** A simple email subscription form.

A key highlight of this project is its smooth, single-page navigation and dynamic animations, all built with vanilla JavaScript.

### **Technologies Used**

- **HTML5:** For structuring the page with semantic and well-organized sections.
- **CSS3:** For styling, including advanced layouts (Flexbox, Grid), responsive design, and smooth transitions.
- **JavaScript (ES6+):** For implementing smooth scrolling, form validation, and other dynamic features like the animated user stories.
