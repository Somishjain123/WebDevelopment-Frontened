Skill Swap Platform (Front-End)
This repository contains the front-end code for a "Skill Swap" platform. This project showcases my skills in building a dynamic and responsive user interface, with a key focus on showcasing a live, interactive chat feature.

Project Overview
This project is a multi-page website that includes a homepage, sections for features and user stories, and a functional chat module. It is a work in progress, but it demonstrates my ability to create a clean, modern, and engaging user experience.

Current Status: The front-end is fully complete. It includes responsive design, form validation, and a dark mode toggle.
Backend Integration: The live chat functionality is built with Firebase, showcasing my experience with real-time database services and API integration.
Future Improvements: I plan to add a full backend and user authentication system in the future to make the platform fully functional.
